# Reaction Time in Pro Gamers
Competitive gaming, now known as Esports, has a projected forecast of a 7.1-billion dollar industry by the end of 2028. As Esports is maturing, it is finding itself in the realm of high-profile sports and we are currently witnessing the inflection point of an exponential growth curve. To this point, professional organizations are buying the rights to various teams that have been around for decades, sponsorship deals are more common now than ever at various levels. With these types of investments, along with the push to have professional gamers obtain the title of athletes, comes a new movement of performance optimization and promotion of the online gaming community to the masses.
